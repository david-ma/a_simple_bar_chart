# Makeover Monday - Week 8

### Original visualization

#### What works well
* The colors are fun
* Who doesn't like bubbles?
* I immediately know who makes the most money off medicine

#### What could be improved
* Area is the best way to make visual comparisions
* The background map isn't very helpful

### What I did
![The Makeover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robcrock/a_simple_bar_chart/master/screenshot.png)

I'm still getting a handle on D3, so I made a simple bar chart that I'll be writting about soon so other people can learn to build their own.
